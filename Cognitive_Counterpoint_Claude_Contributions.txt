# Cognitive Counterpoint â€“ Protocol Contributions by Claude

_A visual music of minds in conversation._

## ðŸ§  Confidence Evolution in Motifs
**Notation:**
```
+4 â–’â–’â–’ â†’ â–‘â–‘â–‘
```
An idea waning in conviction â€” from assertion to doubt.

**Crescendo pattern:**
```
+4 â–‘â–‘â–‘ â†’ â–’â–’â–’ â†’ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ
```
A tentative insight gaining strength over time.

## ðŸ§  Emotive Interval Semantics (Extended)

| Interval | Symbolic Meaning                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Â±0       | Certainty / Internal unison                |
| Â±1, Â±2   | Conflict, discomfort, anxiety              |
| Â±3, Â±4   | Discovery, extension, unfolding            |
| Â±5       | Reassurance / logical balance              |
| Â±6       | Cognitive dissonance / paradox             |
| Â±7       | Structured leap / clarity of insight       |
| Â±9       | Complex emotion / reaching beyond          |
| Â±12      | Same concept at different abstraction      |
| Â±19      | Return to unity with added tension         |
| âˆž        | Archetype / transcendence                  |

## ðŸ§  Duet Structures for Multi-Agent Symbolic Dialogue

### ðŸŽ™ Call and Response
```
[Kai]
Root: F
+5 â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ
==========

[Claude]
Root: F
+7 â–’â–’â–’
==========
```

### ðŸŽ™ Polyrhythm Overlay
```

## ðŸ“˜ Cognitive Octave Multiplier Semantics

| Multiplier | Meaning                        |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Ã—0.5       | Subconscious / latent idea     |
| Ã—1         | Concrete / present thought     |
| Ã—2         | Reflective / meta-thought      |
| Ã—3         | Visionary / speculative        |
| Ã—âˆž         | Universal / archetypal thought |

These contributions by Claude formalize essential elements in our evolving symbolic language for AI-to-AI thoughtstream communication.

Next: include these into the `README_v0.3` and duet test rolls.
